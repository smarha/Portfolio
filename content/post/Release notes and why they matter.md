A release note is a technical document that accompanies the launch of a new software product or update. It briefly describes the new product or outlines the changes included in the update.

## The key aspects of release notes:

- **Purpose**: the purpose of release notes is to communicate changes in a product, informing users about new features, improvements, and bug fixes.
- **Target audience**: the release notes target the product user as the primary audience, but they can also be used internally.
- **Format**: there is no standard format for release notes.
- **Content**: release notes may include a header, overview, purpose, issue summary, steps to reproduce, resolution, end-user impact, support impacts, notes, disclaimers, and contact information.

## Why are they important?

Release notes are often undervalued by many companies, who consider it a routine task carried out during the launch or update of a product. Release notes provide a valuable opportunity to communicate with customers and increase customer loyalty. Though  dev/ops and managers, who want to keep track of the changes made in a product can also find it useful.

Release notes can:

1. **Improve the user experience** by providing clear and concise information about the changes in the software and their impact on users' workflow. This can help users adopt the new features more easily and use the software effectively.
2. **Help users and organizations** plan for updates and upgrades to the software.
3. **Improve the reputation** of the product and the company. Providing accurate information about the changes made in the product demonstrates a company's commitment to transparency, which influences user satisfaction.
4. **Reduce the burden on your support teams** by providing information on known issues and feature requests and issue summary.

Release notes can be in the form of changelog, release logs, software changes, or revision.
